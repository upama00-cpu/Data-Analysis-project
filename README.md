# 📈 Portfolio Projects - How I Designed Two High-Impact Sales Dashboards Using Power BI and Tableau
Data visualization is no longer just a technical task — it has become one of the most essential skills for presenting business insights clearly, quickly, and visually. Whether you’re analyzing sales performance, shipping efficiency, or customer trends, a well-built dashboard can transform raw numbers into real decisions.

In this post, I’m sharing two dashboards I created using Power BI and Tableau. Both dashboards focus on sales analytics, but each follows a different visualization philosophy. Power BI delivers a KPI-driven, business-style interface, while Tableau highlights storytelling and trend analysis.

Let’s walk through both dashboards, the design logic behind them, and what insights they bring to decision-makers.
